context\". second, each application has an entry point to that context. web applications have a servlet, jsf uses a el-resolver, etc. also, there is a place where the application context is bootstrapped and all beans - autowired. in web applications this can be a startup listener. autowiring happens by placing an instance of one bean into the desired field in an instance of another bean. both classes should be beans, i.e. they should be defined to live in the application context. what is \"living\" in the application context? this means that the context instantiates the objects, not you. i.e. - you never make code_removed - the container finds each injection point and sets an instance there. in your controllers, you just have the following: code_removed a few notes: in your code_removed you should enable the code_removed so that classes are scanned for the code_removed, code_removed, etc. annotations. the entry point for a spring-mvc application is the dispatcherservlet, but it is hidden from you, and hence the direct interaction and bootstrapping of the application context happens behind the scene. code_removed should also be defined as bean - either using code_removed or using the code_removed annotation. since it will be the only implementor of code_removed, it will be injected. apart from the code_removed annotation, spring can use xml-configurable autowiring. in that case all fields that have a name or type that matches with an existing bean automatically get a bean injected. in fact, that was the initial idea of autowiring - to have fields

following understanding of springmvc lifecycle-- to put things into places in the overall view: the entire process is request-driven. there is a front controller pattern and the front controller in spring mvc is dispatcherservlet. upon every incoming request from the user, spring manages the entire life cycle as described in here. in the overall view, dispatcherservlet dispatches the request to a controller for a service at the back-end. once this is done, it hands it in to the view component of mvc for its view to be prepared in response to the user. in more detail, dispatcherservlet uses handlers to decide \"which controller\" to serve that request. the controllers are/should be \"light-weighted\"-- should be decoupled from the service processes at back end as a good design practice-- they hold references to the service(s) and invoke the right one(s). their \"mission\" is to control the service process(es) for building the model and handing it back to the dispatcher for the next step. the view component in itself has 2 parts: first the viewresolver picks the right type of look for view to put the model into the final format for the user. from the developer's angle-- the dispatcherservlet is a behind-the-scenes thing. all i do is to define, and configure it, if necessary, in web.xml. as the developer, i instantiate an applicationcontext (there are many applicationcontext types-- i pick one depending on what i need, typically the webapplicationcontext(?) ). aplicationcontext is the factory that creates all the servlets/beans including the dispatcherservlet, using their descriptions in the.xml files. the dispatcherservlet then runs behind the scenes and manages the entire process-- goes&gets the controllers, using the annotations or the their.xml descriptions, views, handlers, validators etc. i am wondering whether this description is holds-- valid&complete, and whether there are big missing pieces in it. thanks in advance.", "is

\"business service facade\" (in the core j2ee patterns sense), or something similar. this annotation is a general-purpose stereotype and individual teams may narrow their semantics and use as appropriate. if you look at domain driven design by eric evans, a service is an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the model, without encapsulating state, as entities and value objects do. services are a common pattern in technical frameworks, but they can also apply in the domain layer. the name service emphasizes the relationship with other objects. unlike entities and value objects, it is defined purely in terms of what it can do for a client. a service tends to be named for an activity, rather than an entity\u2014a verb rather than a noun. a service can still have an abstract, intentional definition; it just has a different flavor than the definition of an object. a service should still have a defined responsibility, and that responsibility and the interface fulfilling it should be defined as part of the domain model. operation names should come from the ubiquitous language or be introduced into it. parameters and results should be domain objects. services should be used judiciously and not allowed to strip the entities and value objects of all their behavior. but when an operation is actually an important domain concept, a service forms a natural part of a model-driven design. declared in the model as a service, rather than as a phony object that doesn't actually represent anything, the standalone operation will not mislead anyone. and a code_removed as per eric evans, a repository represents all objects of a certain type as a conceptual set (usually emulated). it acts like a collection, except with more elaborate querying capability. objects of the appropriate type are added and removed, and the machinery behind the repository inserts them or deletes them from the database. this definition gathers a cohesive set of

differences between @component, @repository, @controller and @service @component this is a general-purpose stereotype annotation indicating that the class is a spring component. what\u2019s special about @component code_removed only scans code_removed and does not look for code_removed, code_removed and code_removed in general. they are scanned because they themselves are annotated with

code_removed. they are scanned because they themselves are annotated with code_removed annotation. if we define our own custom annotation and annotate it with code_removed, then it will also get scanned with code_removed @repository this is to indicate that the class defines a data repository. what\u2019s special about @repository? in addition to pointing out that this is an annotation based

code_removed, that we are required to add in our spring\u2019s application context like this: code_removed this bean post processor adds an advisor to any bean that\u2019s annotated with code_removed so that any platform-specific exceptions are caught and then rethrown as one of spring\u2019s unchecked data access exceptions. @controller the code_removed annotation indicates that a particular class serves the role of a controller. the code_removed annotation acts as a stereotype for the annotated class, indicating its role. what\u2019s special about @controller? we cannot switch this annotation with any other like code_removed or code_removed, even though they look same. the dispatcher scans the classes annotated with code_removed and detects code_removed annotations within them. we can only use code_removed on code_removed annotated classes. @service code_removed hold business logic and call method in repository layer. what\u2019s special about @service? apart from the fact that it is used to indicate that it's holding the business logic, there\u2019s no noticeable speciality that this annotation provides, but who knows, spring may add some additional exceptional in future. what else? similar to above, in future spring may choose to add special functionalities for code_removed, code_removed and code_removed based on their layering conventions. hence its always a

user in a controller. for other beans, spring has adopted the suggestions of the author and simplified the injection of 'securitycontextholder'. more details are in the comments. this is the solution i've ended up going with. instead of using code_removed in my controller, i want to inject something which uses code_removed under the hood but abstracts away that singleton-like class from my code. i've found no way to do this other than rolling my own interface, like so: code_removed now, my controller (or whatever pojo) would look like this: code_removed and, because of the interface being a point of decoupling, unit testing is straightforward. in this example i use mockito: code_removed the default implementation of the interface looks like this: code_removed and, finally, the production spring config looks like this: code_removed it seems more than a little silly that spring, a dependency injection container of all things, has not supplied a way to inject something similar. i understand code_removed was inherited from acegi, but still. the thing is, they're so close - if only code_removed had a getter to get the underlying code_removed instance (which is an interface), you could inject that. in fact, i even opened a jira issue to that effect. one last thing - i've just substantially changed the answer i had here before. check the history if you're curious but, as a coworker pointed out to me, my previous answer would not work in a multi-threaded environment. the underlying code_removed used by code_removed is, by default, an instance of code_removed, which

detail(source: spring in action 4): explanation when the request leaves the browser (1), it carries information about what the user is asking for. at the least, the request will be carrying the requested url. but it may also carry additional data, such as the information submitted in a form by the user. the first stop in the request\u2019s travels is at spring\u2019s dispatcherservlet. like most java- based web frameworks, spring mvc funnels requests through a single front controller servlet. a front controller is a common web application pattern where a single servlet delegates responsibility for a request to other components of an application to per- form actual processing. in the case of spring mvc, dispatcherservlet is the front controller. the dispatcherservlet\u2019s job is to send the request on to a spring mvc controller. a controller is a spring component that processes the request. but a typical application may have several controllers, and dispatcherservlet needs some help deciding which controller to send the request to. so the dispatcherservlet consults one or more handler mappings (2) to figure out where the request\u2019s next stop will be. the handler mapping pays particular attention to the url carried by the request when making its decision. once an appropriate controller has been chosen, dispatcherservlet sends the request on its merry way to the chosen controller (3). at the controller, the request drops off its payload (the information submitted by the user) and patiently waits while the controller processes that information. (actually, a well-designed controller per- forms little or no processing itself and instead delegates responsibility for the business logic to one or more service objects.) the logic performed by a controller often results in some information that needs to be carried back to the user and displayed in the browser. this information is referred to as the model. but sending raw information back to the user isn\u2019t suffi- cient\u2014it needs to be formatted in a user-friendly format, typically html. for that, the information needs to be given to a view, typically a javaserver page (jsp). one of the last things a controller does is package up the model data and identify the name of a view that should render the output. it then sends the request, along with the model and view name, back to the dispatcherservlet (4). so that the controller doesn\u2019t get coupled to a particular view, the view name passed back to dispatcherservlet doesn\u2019t directly identify a specific jsp. it doesn\u2019t even necessarily suggest that the view is a jsp. instead, it only carries a logical name that will be used to look up the actual view that will produce the result. the dispatcherservlet consults a view resolver (5) to map the logical view name to a spe- cific view implementation, which may or may not be a jsp. now that dispatcherservlet knows which view will render the result, the request\u2019s job is almost over. its final stop is at the view implementation (6), typically a jsp, where it delivers the model data. the request\u2019s job is finally done. the view will use the model data to render output that will be carried back to the client by the (not- so-hardworking) response object (7).", "i am learning springmvc, started a tutorial, i put all the jars in the library, but i got: code_removed", "i am developing a webapp using spring mvc 3 and have the code_removed catching all requests to '/' like so (web.xml): code_removed now this works as advertised, however how can i handle static content?

dispatches the request to a controller for a service at the back-end. once this is done, it hands it in to the view component of mvc for its view to be prepared in response to the user. in more detail, dispatcherservlet uses handlers to decide \"which controller\" to serve that request. the controllers are/should be \"light-weighted\"-- should be decoupled from the service processes at back end as a good design practice-- they hold references to the service(s) and invoke the right one(s). their \"mission\" is to control the service process(es) for building the model and handing it back to the dispatcher for the next step. the view component in itself has 2 parts: first the viewresolver picks the right type of look for view to put the model into the final format for the user. from the developer's angle-- the dispatcherservlet is a behind-the-scenes thing. all i do is to define, and configure it, if necessary, in web.xml. as the developer, i instantiate an applicationcontext (there are many applicationcontext types-- i pick one depending on what i need, typically the webapplicationcontext(?) ). aplicationcontext is the factory that creates all the servlets/beans including the dispatcherservlet, using their descriptions in the.xml files. the dispatcherservlet then runs behind the scenes and manages the entire process-- goes&gets the controllers, using the annotations or the their.xml descriptions, views, handlers, validators etc. i am wondering whether this description is holds-- valid&complete, and whether there are big missing pieces in it. thanks in advance.", "@requestparam annotation used for accessing the query parameter values from the request. look at the following request url: code_removed in the above url request, the values for param1 and param2 can

ignoring the getters/setters during serialization: code_removed and code_removed. explanation for jackson to work well, one of the two sides of the relationship should not be serialized, in order to avoid the infite loop that causes your stackoverflow error. so, jackson takes the forward part of the reference (your code_removed in trainee class), and converts it in a json-like storage format; this is the so-called marshalling process. then, jackson looks for the back part of the reference (i.e. code_removed in bodystat class) and leaves it as it is, not serializing it. this part of the relationship will be re-constructed during the deserialization (unmarshalling) of the forward reference. you can change your code like this (i skip the useless parts): business object 1: code_removed business object 2: code_removed now it all should work properly. if you want more informations, i wrote an article about json and jackson stackoverflow issues on keenformatics, my blog. edit: another useful annotation you could check is @jsonidentityinfo: using it, everytime jackson serializes your object, it will add an id (or another attribute of your choose) to it, so that it won't entirely \"scan\" it again everytime. this can be useful when you've got a chain loop between more interrelated objects (for example: order -> orderline -> user -> order and over again). in this case you've got to be careful, since you could need to read your object's attributes more than once (for example in a products list with more products that share the same seller), and this annotation prevents you to do so. i suggest to always take a look at firebug logs to check the json response and see what's going on in your code. sources: keenformatics - how to solve json infinite recursion stackoverflow

what a servlet filter is and how it works? it's a very useful piece of the servlet spec, allowing us to apply aop-like concepts to servicing of http requests. many frameworks use filter implementations for various things, and it's not uncommon to find custom implementations of them because they've very simple to write and useful. in a spring app, most of the stuff that your app can do is in your spring beans. a filter instance, though, is controlled by the servlet container. the container instantiates, initializes, and destroys it. the servlet spec doesn't require any kind of spring integration, though, so you're left with a really useful concept (filters) with no convenient way of tying it to your spring app and the beans that do the work. enter the delegatingfilterproxy. you write a filter implementation and make it a spring bean, but instead of adding your own filter class to the web.xml, you use the delegatingfilterproxy, and give it the bean name of your filter in the spring context. (if you don't explicitly provide a name, it uses the \"filter-name\".) then at runtime, the delegatingfilterproxy handles the complexity of finding the real implementation - the one you wrote and configured in spring - and routing requests to it. so at runtime, it's as if you had listed your filter in the web.xml, but you get the benefit of being able to wire it like any other spring bean. if you take that filter mapping out of your web.xml, everything will continue working, but none of your urls will be secured.

something like this in the code_removed file: code_removed notice that the filter is actually a code_removed, and not the class that will actually implement the logic of the filter. what code_removed does is delegate the filter's methods through to a bean which is obtained from the spring application context. this enables the bean to benefit from the spring web application context lifecycle

(during deserialization). if this is not what you're looking for, please keep reading below. (thanks to as zammel alaaeddine for pointing this out). jsonmanagedreference and jsonbackreference since jackson 1.6 you can use two annotations to solve the infinite recursion problem without ignoring the getters/setters during serialization: code_removed and code_removed. explanation for jackson to work well, one of the two sides of the relationship should not be serialized, in order to avoid the infite loop that causes your stackoverflow error. so, jackson takes the forward part of the reference (your code_removed in trainee class), and converts it in a json-like storage format; this is the so-called marshalling process. then, jackson looks for the back part of the reference (i.e. code_removed in bodystat class) and leaves it as it is, not serializing it. this part of the relationship will be re-constructed during the deserialization (unmarshalling) of the forward reference. you can change your code like this (i skip the useless parts): business object 1: code_removed business object 2: code_removed now it all should work properly. if you want more informations, i wrote an article about json and jackson stackoverflow issues on keenformatics, my blog. edit: another useful annotation you could check is @jsonidentityinfo: using it, everytime jackson serializes your object, it will add an id (or another attribute of your choose) to it, so that it won't entirely \"scan\" it again everytime. this can be useful when you've got a chain loop between more interrelated objects (for example: order -> orderline -> user -> order and over again). in this case you've got to be careful, since you could need to read your object's attributes more than once (for example in a products list with more products that share the same seller), and this annotation prevents you to do so. i suggest to always take a look at firebug logs to check the json response and see what's going on in your code. sources: keenformatics -

files (it's called java configuration). spring needs to know which packages contain spring beans, otherwise you would have to register each bean individually. that's what code_removed is used for. in your example, you tell spring that package code_removed contains classes which should be handled by spring. spring then finds a class annotated with code_removed, and processes it, which results in all requests coming to code_removed being intercepted by the controller. when the request is intercepted, spring needs to know what response to send to the caller. since you return an instance of code_removed, it will try to find a view (jsp page) called code_removed in your project (details of this depend on configured view resolvers), and renders it to the user. if code_removed annotation

component. @repository, @service, and @controller are specializations of @component for more specific use cases, for example, in the persistence, service, and presentation layers, respectively. therefore, you can annotate your component classes with @component, but by annotating them with @repository, @service, or @controller instead, your classes are more properly suited for processing by tools or associating with aspects. for example, these stereotype annotations make ideal targets for pointcuts. it is also possible that @repository, @service, and @controller may carry additional semantics in future releases of the spring framework. thus, if you are choosing between using @component or @service for your service layer, @service is clearly the better choice. similarly, as stated

if model contains only single value, we can write as follows: code_removed", "let's go into detail step by step dispatcherservlet uses handlers to decide \"which controller\" to serve that request the code_removed maintains an ordered code_removed of code_removed beans (which it loaded from the code_removed). a code_removed is interface to be implemented by objects that define a mapping between requests and handler objects. when the code_removed receives a request, it iterates over this list until it finds a matching handler object for the request in question. for simplicity, let's consider only code_removed. a bean of this type stores a mapping of code_removed annotated methods (the actual code_removed object retrieved with reflection) stored as a code_removed instances and wrapped in code_removed objects that hold mapping data for matching the request, ie. url, headers, and request parameters. the code_removed retrieves the best matching code_removed from these and any corresponding code_removed instances which you may have registered. it retrieves these as a code_removed object. it will first apply any pre-handling by code_removeds. it will then try to invoke your code_removed. this will typically (but not always) be a code_removed annotated method inside a code_removed annotated class. this produces what spring calls a dispatch result. the code_removed then applies post-handling by the code_removeds. it finally processes the dispatch result depending on what it is. you can see the supported return types for an idea of what that can be. the controllers are/should be \"light-weighted\"-- should be decoupled from the service processes at back end as a good design practice-- they hold references to the service(s) and invoke the right one(s). their \"mission\" is to control the service process(es) for building the model and handing it back to the dispatcher for the next step. in an mvc application, the controller controls operations by making changes to the model. you can do this directly in your controller or you can decouple it by implementing and providing service and business classes for that purpose. the controller depends on these, but not the other way around. check out multilayered architectures. the controller then builds the model (code_removed) which the code_removed possibly makes available to the view. i say possibly because the controller can produce a response directly without any view (think code_removed) involved. the view component in itself has 2 parts: first the viewresolver picks the right type of look for view to put the model into the final format for the user. in the typical case where the controller handler method would return a code_removed, code_removed, code_removed, code_removed (and some others) object, then a code_removed would handle finding the correct code_removed. the code_removed then tries to render that view by first merging the model as you said. this usually means taking all code_removed attributes and putting them into the code_removed attributes. the rendering step can involve rendering a code_removed, generating xml, or anything at all really. from the developer's angle-- the dispatcherservlet is a behind-the-scenes thing. all i do is to define, and configure it, if necessary, in web.xml. as the developer, i instantiate an applicationcontext (there are many applicationcontext types-- i pick one depending on what i need, typically the webapplicationcontext(?) ). you don't actually need to instantiate it. the code_removed will do that itself (or use the code_removed's) when the code_removed container calls code_removed on it. it will generate its own code_removed. what you can do is decide which subclass of code_removed to use. this is an important choice if you want to load your context from xml or from a java configuration. you can do this by providing an code_removed. aplicationcontext is the factory that creates all the servlets/beans including the dispatcherservlet, using their descriptions in the.xml files. the dispatcherservlet then runs behind the scenes and manages the entire process-- goes&gets the controllers, using the annotations or the their.xml descriptions, views, handlers, validators etc. the code_removed is also known as the inversion of control container. it does not include the code_removed. the code_removed is managed by the code_removed container and not by spring. however, it does primarily take its configuration from spring's code_removed (code_removed). it registers a number of special beans it finds in the context. you can declare these yourself or let spring do it for you with this little bit of xml code_removed this will (mostly) take care of doing what you describe, ie. registering handlers, validators, views, etc. i am wondering whether this description is holds-- valid&complete, and whether there are big missing pieces in it. don't forget that a spring mvc web application is a code_removed web application. the lifecycle of the application is therefore tied to the code_removed container.", "if you are using maven as build tool for project, build your project properly,your

but i thought i throw my hat in the ring and see if i can muddy the water a little bit more:) i found my initial struggle to understand code_removed was a result of spring's decision to combine several annotations into one. it became clearer once i split it into several smaller annotations: for parameter annotations, think of code_removed as the equivalent of code_removed i.e. it tries to retrieve a bean with the given name from the spring managed model. if the named bean is not found, instead of throwing an error or returning code_removed, it implicitly takes on the role of code_removed i.e. create a new instance using the default constructor and add the bean to the model. for method annotations, think of code_removed as the equivalent of code_removed, i.e. it puts the bean constructed by user's code in the model and it's always called before a request handling method. figuratively, i see code_removed as the following (please don't take it literally!!): code_removed

code_removed in your code(here code_removed field in code_removed class) the hibernate gets that from database, now the problem is that you are getting the collection in your controller (where the jpa session is closed).this is the line of code that causes the exception (where you are loading the code_removed collection): code_removed you are getting \"comments\" collection (topic.getcomments()) in your controller(where code_removed has ended) and that causes the exception. also if you had got the code_removed collection in your jsp file like this(instead of getting it in your controller): code_removed you would still have the same exception for the same reason. solving the problem: because you just can have only two collections with the code_removed(eagerly fetched collection) in an entity class and because lazy loading is more efficient than eagerly loading, i think this way of solving your problem is better than just changing the code_removed to eager: if you want to have collection lazy initialized, and also make this work, it is better to add this snippet of code to your code_removed: code_removed what this code does is that it will increase the length of your code_removed or as the documentation says, it is used code_removed so this way the jpa session will be open a bit longer and because of that you can lazily load collections in your jsp files and

create controller classes (either by extending a spring controller class or marking a class with the @controller annotation). the \"mission\" of the controller is to perform necessary processing of requests. they do not just \"control service processes\" there is no \"hand it back\" to the dispatcher. the dispatchservlet must be configured in the web.xml file, this is never optional. you can

allowing us to apply aop-like concepts to servicing of http requests. many frameworks use filter implementations for various things, and it's not uncommon to find custom implementations of them because they've very simple to write and useful. in a spring app, most of the stuff that your app can do is in your spring beans. a filter instance, though, is controlled by the servlet container. the container instantiates, initializes, and destroys it. the servlet spec doesn't require any kind of spring integration, though, so you're left with a really useful concept (filters) with no convenient way of tying it to your spring app and the beans that do the work. enter the delegatingfilterproxy. you write a filter implementation and make it a spring bean, but instead of adding your own filter class to the web.xml, you use the delegatingfilterproxy, and give it the bean name of your filter in the spring context. (if you don't explicitly provide a name, it uses the \"filter-name\".) then at runtime, the delegatingfilterproxy handles the complexity of finding the real implementation - the one you wrote and configured in spring - and routing requests to it. so at runtime, it's as if you had listed your filter in the web.xml, but you get the benefit of being able to wire it like any other spring bean. if you take that filter mapping out of your web.xml, everything will continue working, but none of your urls will be secured.
